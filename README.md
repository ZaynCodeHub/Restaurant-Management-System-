# Restaurant-Management-System-

The project is based on a “Restaurant Management System”.
The use of structures,arrays,filing,nested switch cases and certain exquisite functions were implemented   to built this project
The project consists of a Admin login  panel as well as a User login panel and an exit option that gets prompted as soon as you access the programme.
Admin panel consists of key elements such as the menu code that derives “menu view/edit” as well as the “employee list”
Where as the user login panel consists of registering as a new user or logging in as an older one and it further proceeds to prompt the “main menu” and offers the service to “order food” and compute/calculate its resulting bill moreover directs us to the contact information of the “Delivery boy”
